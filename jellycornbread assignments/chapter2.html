<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<p>The very important meeting ends nothing happened in the meeting execpt FOR EVERYTHING. Really guys, alot of crap goes down.
  For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Elijah was brought up on a regluar basis.</li>
	<li>A fight of when Gladia had meet the earthan and how long ago it was.</li>
	<li>Alot of robot help as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>There was a lot of flash backs.Turns out Gladia doent like Dr.Amarido. Then the agurment between when she meet a Dr.fastlofe. (just under 6 months of her being pregnant with her son.</p>


<p>Really this entire chapeter is a debate on this and that dis-agrement and robots.</p>
