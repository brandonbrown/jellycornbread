<h1>Chapter 5</h1>
<p>Just returning from her trip with a settler(a little meeting)Gladia happily went to sleep. Gladia was very tired she said to herself she would only take a trip if the needs where dire. but not to soon she found herself on a trip to soliora. AkA her home planet she left more than 20 decades ago. but this time it was business. She needed to know how her planet was doing. 
	  D.G  was with her tall and bearded. They need to gather as much information. Gladia didn't recall much. But she didnt recall where her estate was. She could recall she had at least a thousand robots(holy crap calm done woman!) but only 3 dozen by site.They would arrive in the morning.And they just narrowed down where the estate may be.
